This is a template for FL Studio 20+  
It's vastly empty but the name is a reference to the mixer routing, which features:  
- pre master track  
- Low, mid high  
- Percussion, audio, bass and synth busses  
- 5 sends + mono channel  


It aims to be flexible enough to support easy mixing, mastering, sound design, and general production. 


# Requires
- FL Studio >= 20.8.4.2072
